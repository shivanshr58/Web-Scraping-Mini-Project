# Web-Scraping-Mini-Project
In this project, I will scrape data for second-hand cars for sale in Meerut on Olx. I will utilize the requests library to fetch the HTML and then parse it using Beautiful Soup. Following that, I will clean the data by fixing the data types, making it ready for analysis. Finally, I will create some visuals to understand the data more effectively.
